    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone, I am Alex, a software developer from Austria. 
        I am mainly a Java Developer and have worked with
        Java EE with an WildFly Server.
        Additionally I have experience with Angular/AngularJS. 
        I got my Bachelors at the TU Vienna and am currently
        studying for my Masters Degree at Technikum Wien.
        Microservices have gained my interest, especially the Quarkus Framework. 
    </p>
    <h2>My Stuff</h2>
    <p>
        My Microservice-Lab Repo deals with possible solutions for Microservice architecture.
        You could say it's my Coding Playground. Currently I am working with the Quarkus Framework 
        for the microservices themself, KeyCloak for authentication and Graylog for logging.
        I will try to write mini tutorials on how to do stuff.
    </p>
